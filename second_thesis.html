								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Gold.png" alt="" /></span>The purpose of my second bachelor thesis was to support applications that employ artificial intelligence
								(AI) to capture the knowledge of experts. These applications use these insights to arrive
								at certain conclusions and work in a “smarter” way that resembles the human way
								of thinking. I aimed to answer the question as to how we can capture expert
								knowledge using rules in a streamlined, simple, and elegant user interface. This interface
								should be both easy to understand for the experts, who might not necessarily be familiar
								with computers, and also capable of making this data easily available for a rule-based
								expert system. Capturing expert knowledge is done via so-called rules in which experts
								express their understandings of a certain domain. A rule resembles a simplified way that
								a human would look at solving a problem.</p>
								<p>Readers were also introduced to the inner workings of mobile UI design standards and
								explain the differences between designing for an Android or iOS application. Addition-
								ally, the basics of creating complex rules for artificial intelligence using expert knowledge
								were covered. Since rules need to closely capture a human’s way of thinking, fuzzy logic
								is applied to each rule. This logic closer resembles the kind of common sense that a
								human relies on to solve a problem compared to the stricter Boolean logic, where every
								boundary is exactly defined. Related works and comparable solutions were compared,
								discussed and evaluated.</p>
								<p>Building on this knowledge, an application with an intuitive user interface that helps
								to create complex rules, has been conceptualized and implemented. Rules created by
								this application can be exported in a common file format to be further used in a soft-
								ware system, which uses expert knowledge and rules, to achieve its goals or make certain
								features possible. The data and knowledge for these rules can be limited to a certain
								category, e.g. sports or simple use cases like tipping in a restaurant, but are designed to
								be able to depict any kind of knowledge of experts in a given domain.</p>
