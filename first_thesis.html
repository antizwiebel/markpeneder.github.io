								<h3>Short Abstract</h3>
								<p>My first Bachelor thesis was intended as an introduction to the open source computer vision and machine
								learning software library for Android. The various features and possible uses as well as
								the current limitations of OpenCV were covered. The most basic and widely used image
								processing functions were applied and explained using an Android application.
								OpenCV is one of the most popular open source libraries for computer vision and
								machine learning. It provides over 2000 algorithms for various areas in computer vision
								and machine learning. Those algorithms offer efficient store management and memory
								allocation is mostly not a problem, making this library also suitable for beginners in
								programming. OpenCV offers programming interfaces for most modern programming
								languages and operating systems. The Android distribution, which has been used to
								implement the practical part, is available since 2010.</p>
								<p>Image processing can be used in many fascinating ways. It can be used to edit images directly.
								For example, one could change the contrast of an image using histogram equalization.
								But there are also ways to extract information out of an image without changing itâ€™s
								content. One common use case for this would include the detection of objects in an
								image.</p>
								<p>The theory behind image processing and conclusions of this thesis were applied in an
								Android app which was inspired by image-editing programs that can be found on most
								modern smart phones. The implementation of ten different algorithms that can be used
								to edit an image were covered and explained in more detail.</p>
